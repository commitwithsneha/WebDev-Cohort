# Mintlify-Inspired Documentation Website (Desktop-First)

This project recreates a **desktop-first documentation-style website inspired by Mintlify**.  
The focus is on **content structure, readability, spacing, and layout accuracy**, rather than interactivity or responsiveness.

The implementation strictly follows the assignment constraints and aims to be **structurally and visually close** to the original Mintlify documentation site.
